# Low Cost EEG Emotions Classification

The project uses a EEG from the user to control a simplified keyboard using steady state visually evoked potentials.

On start-up, the user should stare at one of the checker boxes to record a baseline EEG. Once the checkerboxes start flashing, the user can start making selections. There are five flashing checkerboxes, each flashing at a different frequency. Each box also has some comma separated options above them, which can be selected
By the user looking and concentrating on it. The box will be highlighted and the options sub-divided between the checker boxes. This repeats until a single option is selected. If the option is a letter/number it will be displayed in the text box.
